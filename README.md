Welcome to YueyangYan’s GitHub Pages
I’m Yueyang Yan. It is my third year to study in Lehigh University. My majors are Journalism and Japanese.

I’m a TA for elementary Japanese courses, and I’m also in Lehigh’s news agency——Brown and White. My main job in Brown and White is interviewing, analyzing the data, writing the report and taking photos.
How does the COVID-19 impact adults' mental health?

### How does the COVID-19 impact adults' mental Health?
![COVID](https://github.com/YueyangYan/YueyangYan.github.io/blob/main/COVID.png?raw=true)

Background information: The epidemic has brought people not only pain but also internal trauma, with many people suffering from anxiety and depression in a closed environment.
Key findings: Depression is most common among 18 - to 24-year-olds, many of whom turn to alcohol and drugs for relief.

Implications: (Here are the words from experts) History has shown that the mental health impact of disasters outlasts the physical impact, suggesting today’s elevated mental health need will continue well beyond the coronavirus outbreak itself. For example, an analysis of the psychological toll on health care providers during outbreaks found that psychological distress can last up to three years after an outbreak. Due to the financial crisis accompanying the pandemic, there are also significant implications for mortality due to “deaths of despair.” A May 2020 analysis projects that, based on the economic downturn and social isolation, additional deaths due to suicide and alcohol or drug misuse may occur by 2029.

### The United States commercial energy-related CO2 emmissions 2009-2019
This is a line chart created using Chartbuilder showing Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions of the commercial sector in the U.S. from 2009 to 2019. The data source is from Environmental Protection Agency, (https://www.statista.com/statistics/790977/commercial-co2-energy-emissions-in-the-us/). From this line chart, we can see the purchased electricity is decreasing, even the change of direct use is not apparent, it is rising steaily. In 2018, it had the lowest volume emitted since 2009. I think 2010 can be a key year which after 2010, the purchased electricity was decreasing apprantly. By the end of 2019, solar power in the United States accounted for 4 percent of total energy, moving from a niche technology to a dominant source of new energy, it can be a correlated factor of decreasig of purchased electricity. In 2030, extrapolating from this scenario, electricity purchases are expected to fall to 50 percent of 2009 levels.

### Tableau--Drink Before Party Depends on Party Location
This chart is created by Yueyang Yan, using the Tableau. The source is from Lehigh Party Scene Survey. This graph shows which student groups are more likely to drink alcohol before the party starts at an off campus or on campus party. This graph shows that students are more likely to drink before the party on campus, it follows that because it is safer on campus than off, so they can drink before the party without worries.
